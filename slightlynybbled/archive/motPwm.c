 * 	Function:	void MPWM_setPhaseDutyCycle(uint8_t phase, uint8_t state, uint16_t dutyCycle);
 *
 * 	Purpose:	To provide a clean and easy interface with which to interact with the phase
 * 					duty cycles.
 *
 * 	Parameters:	uint8_t phase 		Valid values are PH_A, PH_B, and PH_C.  This
 * 									parameter will determine which phase is being
 * 									modified when the function is called.
 * 				uint8_t state		Valid values are HI_STATE, LO_STATE, and DORMANT.
 * 									This parameter will determine the polarity of the
 * 									phase or, in the case of DORMANT, will render the
 * 									high-side and low-side FETs inactive
 * 				uint16_t dutyCycle	Valid values range from 0 to 65535, which corresponds
 * 									to 0% - 100% duty cycle
 *
 * 	Notes:		PWM is edge-aligned with a preset dead time of about 1us.  On a particular phase,
 * 				one FET is always active except during dead-time when HI_STATE or LO_STATE has been
 * 				entered as one of the parameters.  This can result in motor states which are highly
 * 				regenerative when the user is attempting to slow a motor down.
 *
 * 	Example:	The user wants to have current from phase B to phase A at an effective duty cycle
 * 				of 28.3%.  First, convert the number to the fixed-point domain: 28.3% of 65535 is 18546.
 * 				Then, call the functions to setup the appropriate outputs:
 * 				setPhaseDutyCycle(PH_C, DORMANT, 0);
 * 				setPhaseDutyCycle(PH_B, HI_STATE, 18546);
 * 				setPhaseDutyCycle(PH_A, LO_STATE, 18546);
